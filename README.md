# FluidEngine

Simulating realistic fluids such as water is highly desirable in interactive applications as it improves the visual fidelity of the virtual world, making it immersive and dynamic. Yet such a feature remains largely unseen in interactive applications due to the chal-
lenges that make simulating fluids difficult. This project investigates these challenges by implementing a variation of the Weakly Compressible Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics method on multi-threaded CPU and visualizing the fluidâ€™s surface with Screen Space Fluids. The resulting 3D simulation demonstrates various fluid types at interactive frame rates.
